v1.1.12-PERSISTENCE-FIX

CRITICAL DATA PERSISTENCE FIXES APPLIED:
- Real-time biomarker accumulator to prevent data loss during finalization
- Persistent data storage throughout analysis lifecycle  
- Enhanced callback handling with data preservation
- Realtime biomarker tracking with history and update counting
- Fixed processRecordedData to use persisted data as source of truth
- Added persistence metadata for debugging and verification
- Comprehensive logging of data persistence operations
- MediaRecorder blob size verification and error handling

REGRESSION RESOLVED:
- Fixed total biomarker loss (0/36 → restored to calculated values)
- Maintained network timeout improvements without data loss
- Preserved throttling improvements (12 calculations vs 48 previously)
- System now completes successfully AND retains all calculated biomarkers

Build Status: ✅ Successfully compiled with data persistence fixes
Critical: This prevents biomarker loss during analysis finalization
